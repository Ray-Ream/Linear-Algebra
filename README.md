Use Python to write linear algebra 
1. Gauss-Jordan elimination method calculation,
2. Inverse Matrix calculation,
3. Determinant value calculation,
4. Gramâ€“Schmidt process,
5. Legendre polynomial verification

In each script, you can enter the matrix to be calculated, or use a text file to calculate the matrix result.
